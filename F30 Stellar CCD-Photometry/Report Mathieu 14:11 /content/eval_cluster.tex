\chapter{Globular Cluster BS90$^{\mathbf{14}}$}
In this part of the experiment we are analyzing the properties of the globular cluster BS90$^{14}$. Unfortunately the bad weather conditions during our measurement prevented us from collecting data by ourselves. Instead we are working with images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST).\\
The goal of this part is to perform PSF fitting for two different filter constellations and match both images and finally plot a Color Magnitude Diagram (CMD) to determine age and metallicity of the cluster after fitting isochrones.

\section{Zeropoint calibration}\label{sec:zeropoint}
To calibrate the measured data to a standard scale, which is in this case the apparent magnitude scale, we are comparing the counts of several standard stars with reference values from SIMBAD, an astronomical data base. From these results we can determine the zeropoint $p_0$ using equation (\ref{eq1.4}): 
	\begin{align*}
		p_0 = m_{\text{CATALOG}} + 2.5\log_{10}(\text{counts})
	\end{align*}
	We choose ten suitable stars, e.g. stars that are clearly isolated and bright enough but not yet saturated.

	%TODO explanation of the errors
	
We take the mean of the calculated zeropoints $p_0$ and compute the standard deviation of our errors and the error progation to get the final results: 
\begin{align*}
	p_{0,\text{V}} &= (25.334 \pm 0.004 \pm 0.011) \\
	p_{0,\text{I}} &= (24.953 \pm 0.004 \pm 0.007)
\end{align*}

\section{PSF photometry with STARFINDER}
We are using \texttt{starfinder} to perform statistical PSF fitting, e.g. the IDL takes the positions of about 10 to 30 isolated, unsaturated stars and applies several corrections (subtraction of an average background and normalization of the peak intensities) to both images. Now the software is able to compare the results for all the stars we chose and to determine the final result: an average PSF for the entire image.
\subsection{Results of the PSF fitting}
We chose about 25 stars and selected the most suitables, e.g. those who were as centered and symmetric as possible for the fitting.

\end{minipage}
\caption{Results of the PSF fit for the I-filter (left) and the V-filter(right).} 
\end{figure} 

With this result \texttt{starfinder} is able to detect all potential stars by dividing the image into smaller parts and checking if the analyzed objects are brighter than the estimated threshold. 
Using this technique the program is only able to determine the instrumental magnitude if the sources. The result from the zeropoint calibration, performed in (\ref{sec:zeropoint}) becomes important now to get the corresponding apparent magnitudes.
After finishing the iterative process for both images we get a list of all stars which could be detected by \texttt{starfinder}. 

\section{Color Magnitude Diagram for BS90$^{\mathbf{14}}$ }
To finally obtain the CMD for our cluster we need to match the stars found in booth pictures. This cross matching process is done with the help of the Python script \texttt{matchstars.py} located on our working computer. 
We are now able to plot the CMD (V versus V-I) and fit matching theoretical isochrones by varying different parameters in the script used for plotting (\texttt{cmdplot.py})such as the \textbf{shift} of the image, the \textbf{metallicity} or the \textbf{age} of the cluster. \\
The result is presented in figure (\ref{fig:CMD}):
